Starlight Engine is a free and open-source game engine written in C++ that is made with simplicity, ease-of-use and performance in mind. Currently, the engine only supports 2D. However, support for 3D is on the way.

⚠️ Starlight is in active development and stability is **not guaranteed**. This can range from bugs and glitches to the engine not even running or crashing.

## 🔽 Installation

### ✅ Stable Releases

As of currently, no stable releases of Starlight are being distributed. Please refer to the following sections for getting a build of the engine.

### ⚠️ Unstable/Bleeding-edge Builds

If you're someone who is looking to get their hands on the latest bleeding-edge changes, these builds are for you. To get your hands on these builds, consider taking a look at the automatic builds which are produced via our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/Ayydxn/StarlightEngine/actions/workflows/build.yml). This is executed every single time a change is pushed to the repository or pull request is made, and as such, these builds reflect the latest changes made in development.

Bleeding-edge builds will often include unfinished code and/or code that has yet to be extensively tested. This code may introduce unwanted behaviour such as bugs, crashes, incomplete features/changes/updates, and other weird issues. **You should NOT use these bleeding-edge builds** unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging, or understand the issues/instabilities that may come from using these builds. Caveat emptor.

## 📝 Reporting Issues

You can report any bugs or issues you come across using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Ayydxn/StarlightEngine/issues). Before opening a new issue, please use the search tool to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported. Issues that are duplicates of one another or don't contain the necessary information needed to debug them may be closed.

Please note that while the issue tracker is open to feature requests, development is and will be primarily focused on platform/hardware compatibility, performance, completing unfinished features, fixing bugs, etc.
